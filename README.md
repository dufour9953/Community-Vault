# Digital Community Vault

This repository contains a lightweight Streamlit application that demonstrates a minimal portal for regenerative communities.

## Running the App

Install dependencies and start Streamlit:

```bash
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```

The app loads initial communities from `communities.json` and lets you add new ones through the submission form.

The interface uses a light theme defined in `.streamlit/config.toml` so you can tweak colors easily.
